Moose population genomics

This repository contains the code used in Dussex et al. (xxxx). 

All data processing was performed using the Generode pipeline (https://github.com/NBISweden/GenErode) with defaults paramaters. 

Data analysis was performed using custom codes which include:

0. Data processing, heterozygosity, inbreeding, genetic load (Generode pipeline)

1. population structure analysis (Admixture)

2. demographic analyses (SMC++ anf GONE)

3. Genome scans (ANGSD)
