Moose population genomics

This repository contains the code used in Dussex et al. (xxxx). 

All data processing was performed using the Generode pipeline (https://github.com/NBISweden/GenErode) with defaults paramaters. 

Data analysis was performed using custom codes which include:

1. population structure analysis (Admixture and PCA - Plink)

2. demographic analyses (SMC++ anf GONE)

3. Genetic load estimates in coding regions (SNPeff)

4. Tests of ourliers detection (ANGSD)
